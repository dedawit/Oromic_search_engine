 interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms however the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself it is usually directly or indirectly derived eg by dimensional reduction from the cooccurrence of those terms in the whole set of documents 
 models with transcendent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined they rely an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms for example a human or sophisticated algorithms 
 the evaluation of an information retrieval system is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users in general measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query traditional evaluation metrics designed for boolean retrievalclarification needed or topk retrieval include precision and recall all measures assume a ground truth notion of relevance every document is known to be either relevant or nonrelevant to a particular query in practice queries may be illposed and there may be different shades of relevance

 document information retrieval consists of finding the documents in a collection of documents that are the most relevant to a user query information retrieval techniques are widelyused by organizations to facilitate the search for information however applying traditional information retrieval techniques is time consuming for large document collections recently clusterbased information retrieval approaches have been developed although these approaches are often much faster than traditional approaches for processing large document collections the quality of the documents retrieved by clusterbased approaches is often less than that of traditional approaches to address this drawback of clusterbased approaches and improve the performance of information retrieval both in terms of runtime and quality of retrieved documents this paper proposes a new clusterbased information retrieval approach named icir intelligent clusterbased information retrieval the proposed approach combines kmeans clustering with frequent closed itemset mining to extract clusters of documents and find frequent terms in each cluster patterns discovered in each cluster are then used to select the most relevant document clusters to answer each user query four alternative heuristics are proposed to select the most relevant clusters and two alternative heuristics for choosing documents in the selected clusters thus eight versions of the proposed approach are obtained to validate the proposed approach extensive experiments have been carried out on wellknown document collections results show that the designed approach outperforms traditional and clusterbased information retrieval approaches both in terms of execution time and quality of the returned documents

 abstract 
 the physical architectures of information storage systems often dictate how information is encoded databases are organized and files are accessed here we show that a simple architecture comprised of a t promoter and a singlestranded overhang domain ssdsdna can unlock dynamic dnabased information storage with powerful capabilities and advantages the overhang provides a physical address for accessing specific dna strands as well as implementing a range of instorage file operations it increases theoretical storage densities and capacities by expanding the encodable sequence space and simplifies the computational burden in designing sets of orthogonal file addresses meanwhile the t promoter enables repeatable information access by transcribing information from dna without destroying it furthermore saturation mutagenesis around the t promoter and systematic analyses of environmental conditions reveal design criteria that can be used to optimize information access this simple but powerful ssdsdna architecture lays the foundation for information storage with versatile capabilities 
 introduction 
 the creation of digital information is rapidly outpacing conventional storage technologies dna may provide a timely technological leap due to its high storage density longevity and energy efficiency a generic dnabased information storage system is shown in fig a where digital information is encoded into a series of dna sequences synthesized as a pool of dna strands read by dna sequencing and decoded back into an electronically compatible form recently a growing body of work has focused on implementing and improving each of these four steps however a relative dearth of research has explored technologies to access and manipulate desired subsets of data within storage databases especially dynamically this is likely because dna synthesis and sequencing are considerably slower processes than electronic writing and reading of data thus dna would likely serve at the level of archival or cold storage where information would be infrequently accessed from a relatively static dna database yet an archival dna database just like electronic versions need not be completely static and would benefit greatly from dynamic properties for example instorage file operations and computations and the ability to repeatedly access dna databases would reduce dna synthesis costs and abrogate the need to store multiple copies of archives therefore implementation of dynamic properties would bring dnabased storage systems one step closer to practical viability 
 a practical system to dynamically access information from a dna database should satisfy three criteria it must be  physically scalable to extreme capacities  compatible with efficient and dense encodings and  repeatedly accessible ideally it would also be modifiable to some extent while these criteria have not yet been achieved in aggregate we were inspired by the creative use of molecular biology approaches in prior work to address some of these challenges for example polymerase chain reaction pcr is the predominant method for information access in dna storage systems and is scalable especially with some modifications while singlestranded dna toeholds and strand displacement have been used for dna computation dna search detection and rewritable information storage the challenge is that in their current form these technologies have inherent limitations and tradeoffs either in physical scalability encoding density or reusability for example while it is currently the most scalable and robust technique pcrbased information access requires a portion of the database to be physically removed and amplified with the number of data copies present dictating the number of times information can be accessed it also requires doublestranded dna dsdna templates to be melted in each cycle during which time primers can bind similar offtarget sequences in the data payload regions thus requiring encoding strategies that tradeoff reducing system densities and capacities to avoid these crossinteractions fig b 
 here we present a dynamic dnabased storage system that satisfies these three criteria it is inspired by work in the synthetic biology and molecular biology communities and by the way cells naturally access information in their genome as described in fig c we engineer an information storage system that has as its fundamental unit a doublestranded dna with a singlestranded overhang ssdsdna a database of information would be comprised of many of such ssdsdna strands with all strands that comprise a file having the same singlestranded overhang sequence or file address the overhang also provides a handle with which a file can be separated as well as operated on instorage all strands have a t promoter enabling transcription of information into rna while the original ssdsdnas are retained and returned to the dna database this system can be created at scale reduces offtarget information access facilitates computationally tractable design of orthogonal file addresses increases information density and theoretical maximum capacity enables repeatable information access with minimal strand copy number required and supports multiple instorage operations this work demonstrates scalable dynamic information access and manipulations can be practical for dnabased information storage for convenience we refer to this system collectively as doris dynamic operations and reusable information storage 
 results 
 ssdsdna strands can be efficiently created in onepot 
 as future dna databases would be comprised of upwards of  distinct strands we first asked if ssdsdnas could be created in a high throughput and parallelized manner we ordered  nucleotide nt singlestranded dnas ssdna with a common  nt sequence that was inset  nt from the  end fig c and a supplementary table  this  nt sequence contained the t rna polymerase promoter but was also used to bind a common primer to fillout and convert the ssdna into a ssdsdna this was achieved by several cycles of thermal annealing and dna polymerase extension eg pcr cycles but with only one primer this resulted in ssdsdna strands with a  nt overhang fig a top we optimized the ratio of ssdna to primer the number of cycles along with other environmental parameters fig a supplementary fig  to maximize the amount of ssdna converted to ssdsdna we found that decreasing the ssdnaprimer ratio past  led to a step change in the amount of ssdsdna produced as quantified by gel electrophoresis supplementary fig b we decided to conservatively work with a  ssdnaprimer ratio at that ratio we found that only  pcr cycles were needed to convert the ssdna into ssdsdna as seen by the upward shift in the dna gel fig a 
 next we tested whether this method could be used to create  distinct ssdsdnas in onepot reactions and if each ssdsdna could then be specifically separated from the mixture fig b we mixed  distinct ssdnas a b and c together added the common primer and performed  pcr cycles to create the ssdsdnas here referred to as files comprised of just one unique strand each we then used biotinlinked  nt dna oligos to bind each ssdsdna ie each file a b and c has a distinct overhang sequence or file address and separated them out from the mixture using magnetic beads functionalized with streptavidin each of these oligos were able to specifically separate only their corresponding file without the other two fig b bottom eq  importantly this separation step could be performed at room temperature  c with only minimal gains observed at higher oligo annealing temperatures of  or  c supplementary fig  eq  the room temperature and isothermal nature of this step is useful for practical dna storage systems and for reducing dna degradation 
 while  nt is a standard pcr primer length we asked if the separation efficiency could be modulated by different overhang lengths and separation temperatures we designed  ssdsdnas with  nt overhangs supplementary fig  we then separated each strand using its specific biotinlinked oligo at  c we observed enhanced separation efficiency for longer oligos mers and mers and at lower temperatures  c and  c supplementary fig b this was in agreement with a thermodynamic analysis using the oligonucleotide properties calculator supplementary fig c methods eqs  
 doris increases density and capacity limits 
 one potential advantage of room temperature separations of files is that the doublestranded portions of the ssdsdnas remain annealed together and may block undesired oligo binding to any similar sequences in the data payload regions the data payload region is the majority of the sequence in the middle of ssdsdnas that contains the stored information to test this hypothesis we created two ssdsdnas fig c one ssdsdna had an overhang that bound oligo a and an internal binding site for oligo b we experimentally verified that by using doris only oligo a but not oligo b could separate out the strand for comparison pcrbased systems melt dsdnas in each cycle allowing primers to bind offtarget within the data payload as expected when pcr was used both oligo a and oligo b bound with oligo b producing undesired truncated products the second strand we tested had an internal binding site and overhang that both were complementary to oligo c we showed that using doris oligo c yielded only the fulllength strand in contrast when using pcr oligo c created both full length and truncated strands 
 we next asked what implications this blocking property of doris had for dnabased information storage as databases increase in size intuitively the likelihood for sequences identical to address sequences either overhangs for doris or primer sites for pcr appearing in data payload regions increases with doris this is not an issue as oligos are blocked from binding the dsdna data payload regions however in pcr primers do bind these data payload regions so previous approaches have developed encoding algorithms that restrict primer sequences addresses from overlapping with any identical or similar sequence in the data payloads typically avoiding hamming distances within 
 to show these relationships quantitatively it is currently intractable to analytically solve for or comprehensively compute the number of addresses available that do not interact with the data payload region even for moderately sized databases therefore we performed monte carlo simulations to estimate the total number of addresses and total capacities achievable address sequences were pcr or were not doris excluded if they appeared in the data payload regions of a database with  distinct dna strands fig d methods to simplify the analysis we used computational codewords to encode the data payload region each codeword is a distinct nt sequence and holds one byte b of digital information the data payload region can be made more information dense by reducing the size of the codewords so more codewords and bytes fit within each fixedlength strand the tradeoff is that smaller codewords will also increase the sequence diversity of the strands the number of possible distinct sequences per strand length due to more codewordcodeword junctions per strand this increases the chance of similar sequences appearing in the payload that conflict with address sequences 
 the simulation assessed whether address sequences would conflict with any sequences in the payload however for doris even if address sequences conflicted with the payload these addresses were allowed the simulation therefore showed that as the payload information density was increased by shrinking codeword length the number of addresses available did not change for doris as no restrictions were placed on addresses other than that they were not allowed to be similar to other addresses fig d left pink also as expected as the payload information density increased the database capacity increased monotonically as the number of file addresses remained the same as did the total number of strands per file fig d right pink in contrast for pcr addresses that appeared in any data payload sequence were excluded the result was that increasing payload information density initially provided a minor benefit to overall capacity fig d right blue but eventually led to a catastrophic drop in capacity as the number of addresses that did not conflict with any payload sequence quickly dropped to zero fig d left blue while it is possible to increase the number of distinct strands per address ie information per file to make up for the loss of addresses this would result in files too large to be sequenced and decoded in a single sequencing run it is also important to note that our simulations were based upon very conservative codeword densities and a database size of only  dna strands while future storage systems are likely to exceed  strands or greater as database densities and dna sequence spaces increase the number of addresses available for pcrbased systems will drop even further while doris will be unaffected therefore the theoretical capacity and density improvements doris provides could be orders of magnitude greater than what is estimated in our simulations furthermore doris greatly simplifies address design designing sets of orthogonal addresses for pcrbased systems that do not interact with data payload sequences will quickly become computationally intractable at large database sizes in summary a database comprised of ssdsdnas can be efficiently created in onepot reactions and ssdna overhangs facilitate a nonpcrbased separation method that enhances address specificity and increases theoretical database densities and capacities 
 doris enables repeatable file access 
 a key requirement but major challenge for engineering dynamic properties into storage systems is the reusability of the system in this work we took inspiration from natural biological systems where information is repeatedly accessed from a single permanent copy of genomic dna through the process of transcription as shown in fig a dynamic access in doris starts by physically separating out a file of interest ssdsdnas sharing the same overhang address using biotinlinked oligos and streptavidinbased magnetic separation in vitro transcribing ivt the dna to rna returning the file to the database and reversetranscribing the rna into cdna for downstream analysis or sequencing 
 we implemented this system with three distinct ssdsdnas a b and c collectively representing a threefile database and we accessed file a with a biotinylated oligo a fig b  supplementary fig  we then measured the amounts and compositions of the retained database light shading and retained file dark shading by qpcr eq  the retained database had higher levels of files b and c compared to a as some of the file a strands were removed in the magnetic separation the retained file contained mostly file a strands with minimal b or c the best net total amount of file a recovered from the retained database and retained file was approximately  of what was originally in the database the high retention rate of file a suggested that a file could be reaccessed multiple times we tested this by repeatedly accessing file a five times and measured the amounts and compositions of file a b and c in the database after each access fig c  supplementary fig c as expected the overall amounts of file b and c were maintained at relatively stable levels in the database approximately  of file a strands remained after five accesses the practical implications for dna storage systems is that only  copies of each distinct sequence are needed in the initial database for every  times it is accessed ignoring the effects of strand distributions this is an improvement over pcrbased file access where small aliquots of the database are taken and amplified in this case one copy of each distinct sequence is needed for each access furthermore unlike in doris all of the other database files will be similarly reduced in abundance even if they were not accessed thus doris may extend the lifespan of dna databases and allow for more frequent access for the same total mass of dna synthesized 
 we next asked how the ivt reaction might affect database stability as it is performed at an elevated temperature of  c and could degrade the ssdsdna while the retained database is not exposed to the ivt the accessed file is and the amount of ssdsdna retained could be affected by the length of the ivt indeed while the presence of rna polymerase itself had no effect on the retained file the length of ivt time did decrease the amount of retained file fig b  supplementary fig a interestingly reannealing the retained file at  c and allowing it to cool back to room temperature improved the retention rate but longer ivt times still reduced overall file retention supplementary fig b this suggests that some loss is due to the file strands unbinding from the beadlinked oligos or rnas competing with ssdsdna while some loss is due to dna degradation as a control to confirm that ssdsdna was not contaminating cdna generated from the transcribed rna cdna was obtained only when rna polymerase was included in the ivt reaction supplementary fig d 
 we next focused on assessing the quality and efficiency of the ivt to check if rna polymerase might be creating undesired truncated or elongated transcripts we ordered a series of six ssdnas with a range of lengths spanning  nt fig a  supplementary fig  these were converted into ssdsdna transcribed into rna and reverse transcribed and amplified into dsdna clear uniform bands were seen for the ssdsdna rna and dsdna increasing ivt time did increase the yield of rna for all templates fig b although just  h was sufficient to obtain clear rna bands fig c and ivt time did not affect the length of the rna generated in summary information can be repeatedly accessed from ssdsdnas by oligobased separation and ivt 
 transcription can be tuned by promoter sequence 
 recent works on molecular information storage have demonstrated the utility of storing additional information in the composition of mixtures of distinct molecules including dna as the information accessed by doris relies on the t rna polymerase and there is evidence that t promoter variants can affect transcription efficiency we asked whether the yield of tbased transcription could be modulated by specific nucleotide sequences around the tpromoter region while keeping the promoter itself constant to allow for onepot ssdsdna generation fig a b to comprehensively address this question we designed and ordered  distinct  nt strands as an oligo pool the first  strands contained all possible  nt variant sequences upstream to the promoter sequence nnnnnpromoter n is each of the four nucleotides and the latter  sequences were all  nt variant sequences downstream of the promoter promoternnn fig a as the nnnnn nucleotides were located in the ssdna overhang we also asked if this region being single stranded versus double stranded had any impact on relative transcriptional efficiencies we first created ssdsdna by primer extension and dsdna by pcr of the ssdna oligo pool both ssdsdna and dsdna databases were processed with ivt at  c for  h followed by rtpcr and nextgeneration sequencing short barcodes were designed in the payload region to identify which promoter variant each sequenced transcript was derived from 
 the abundance of each distinct transcript sequence was normalized to its abundance in the original ssdsdna fig b or dsdna supplementary fig a database eq  a broad and nearly continuous range of normalized abundances was obtained indicating that this approach could be harnessed to create complex compositional mixtures of dna in the future to determine if there may be simple design principles that described promoter efficiency we segmented the  sequences into quartiles based on transcript abundance and imported the data into the weblogo tool we found that g or a at the th position directly upstream and c or t at the rd position directly downstream of the t promoter generally resulted in the highest rna abundances fig c segmenting the data by at content showed that there was a slight preference for  at content upstream of the t promoter and preference for overall low at content downstream of the t promoter fig d 
 this nextgeneration sequencing experiment also provided confidence that doris is scalable to large and complex ssdsdna pools furthermore error analysis of the sequencing reads indicated no systematic deletions truncations or substitutions and overall error levels were well below those already present from dna synthesis fig e 
 doris enables instorage file operations 
 many inorganic information storage systems even cold storage archives maintain the ability to dynamically manipulate files similar capabilities in dnabased systems would significantly increase their value and competitiveness ssdna overhangs have previously been used to execute computations in the context of toehold switches and we therefore hypothesized they could be used to implement instorage file operations as a proofofprinciple we implemented locking unlocking renaming and deleting files and showed these operations could be performed at room temperature fig  
 we started with the threefile database and tested the ability of a biotinlinked oligo a to bind and separate file a at a range of temperatures from  to  c fig a bottom no lock roughly  of file a strands were successfully separated from the database to lock file a we separated file a from the threefile database and mixed in a long  nt ssdna lock that had a  nt complementary sequence to the ssdna overhang of file a with the lock in place oligo a was no longer able to separate the file except at higher temperatures above  c fig a bottom nokey presumably because the lock was melted from the overhang allowing for oligo a to compete to bind the overhang to unlock the file we added the key that was a  nt ssdna fully complementary to the lock we tested different unlocking temperatures and found the key was able to remove the lock at room temperature with the same efficiency as at higher temperatures this is likely due to the long  nt toehold presented by the lock allowing the key to unzip the lock from file a we also optimized the relative molar ratios file a lock key oligo a      to minimize offtarget separation and ensure proper locking we did observe that the temperature at which the lock was added influenced the fidelity of the locking process at  c the locking process worked well when the lock was added at  c there was leaky separation even when no key was added supplementary fig  this may be due to secondary structures preventing some file a strands from hybridizing with locks at low temperatures fortunately locking at  c had reasonable performance thus avoiding the need to elevate the system to  c in the context of a future dna storage system files could first be separated then locked at an elevated temperature then returned to the database thus avoiding exposure of the entire database to elevated temperatures the entire process could otherwise be performed at room temperature 
 we also implemented file renaming and deletion to rename a file with address a to have address b we mixed file a with a  nt ssdna that binds to a with the resultant overhang being address b fig b we added all components at similar ratios to the locking process file renaming oligo accessing oligo     and the renaming oligo was added at  c we then tested how many file strands each oligo a b or c could separate and found that the renaming process completely blocked oligos a or c from separating out the file fig b bottom only oligo b was able to separate the file suggesting that almost all strands were successfully renamed from a to b similarly we successfully renamed file a to c based on the ability of oligos to rename files with near  completion we hypothesized and indeed found that a short  nt oligo fully complementary to a could be used to completely block the overhang of file a and essentially delete it from the database fig b bottom a file could also simply be extracted from a database to delete it as well however this alternative form of blockingbased deletion suggests one way to ensure any leftover file strands that were not completely extracted would not be spuriously accessed in the future 
 discussion 
 as dnabased information storage systems approach practical implementation scalable molecular advances are needed to dynamically access information from them doris represents a proof of principle framework for how inclusion of a few simple innovations can fundamentally shift the physical and encoding architectures of a system in this case ssdsdna strands drive multiple powerful capabilities for dna storage  it provides a physical handle for files and allows files to be accessed isothermally  it increases the theoretical information density and capacity of dna storage by inhibiting nonspecific binding within data payloads and reducing the stringency and overhead of encoding  it eliminates intractable computational challenges associated with designing orthogonal sets of address sequences  it enables repeatable file access via in vitro transcription  it provides control of relative strand abundances and  it makes possible instorage file operations we envision other innovative architectures and capabilities may be on the horizon given rapid advances in dna origami molecular handles and molecular manipulations developed in fields such as synthetic biology 
 beyond the specific capabilities enumerated above one of the greatest benefits we envision doris providing is compatibility with future miniaturized and automated devices in particular doris can operate isothermally and function at or close to room temperature for all steps this has potential advantages for maintaining dna integrity and database stability while also simplifying the design of future automated dna storage devices in addition a single dna database sample can be reused extending the lifespan of storage systems it is also intriguing to consider what other types of instorage operations like lock  unlock can be implemented to offer unique unforeseen capabilities in the future all of these features lend doris to be easily translated to systems with automated fluid handling and magnetic actuation 
 doris is also a fundamentally scalable system the creation of ssdsdna strands is simple and high throughput it is compatible with existing file system architectures including hierarchical addresses and it facilitates scaling of capacity while the need to include the t promoter in every strand does occupy valuable data payload space it is a worthwhile tradeoff the t promoter decreases data density and capacity in a linear fashion yet it more than compensates by simultaneously improving both metrics exponentially by allowing many sequences to appear in the data payload that normally would have to be avoided in pcrbased systems or conversely by allowing the full set of mutually nonconflicting addresses to be used it is also important to note that doris may help solve scalability issues with the encoding process as well crosscomparing all address sequences with all data payload sequences is computationally intractable but the need to do this is eliminated with doris as addresses will not physically interact with data payload sequences future work may assess how doris and other physical innovations may alter and reduce the stringency of encoding and error correction algorithms and subsequently benefit system density and capacity furthermore with the insights into the impact of the sequence space surrounding the t promoter on transcriptional yield an additional layer of information could be stored in the quantitative composition of dna mixtures 
 of course as with all information storage systems there are challenges and questions regarding the efficiency and accuracy of each technology that will be important to address prior to commercial implementation for example future work might assess how each step of doris performs in the context of increasingly diverse and dense pools of strands both in terms of efficiency and information retrieval error rates in particular new materials rna polymerase enzymes and the optimization of reaction conditions could improve dna recovery percentages to drive doris towards a fully reusable system devoting resources and attention to such optimizations need to be balanced with the fact that the field of molecular information storage is nascent and that there are likely a wide range of new capabilities and physical innovations that could be explored and introduced into the field 
 finally we believe this work motivates a merging of work in the fields of dna computation synthetic biology and dna storage instorage computation and file operations could increase the application space of dna storage or identify cuttingedge applications areas such as in the highly parallel processing of extreme levels of information eg medical genomic and financial data doris complements and harnesses the benefits of prior work while providing a feasible path towards future systems with advanced capabilities

 file specificity 
 in fig  we calculated file specificity by the following equation 
 separation efficiency 
 in fig  supplementary figs   and  we calculated the separation efficiency by the following equation 
 theoretical thermodynamic calculations 
 to theoretically estimate the fraction of bound oligos of various lengths and at different temperatures supplementary fig c we calculated the equilibrium constants at each condition 
 where g is the change in gibbs free energy at standard conditions  c ph   r is the gas constant and t is the reaction temperature the gibbs free energy for each oligo was obtained using the oligonucleotide properties calculator the equilibrium constant at each condition was equated to 
 representing the fraction of strands separated out to the total original amount of ssdsdna strands this amount expressed as a percentage is referred to as the separation efficiency 
 density and capacity calculation 
 experimental work was performed using the oligos listed in supplementary table  simulation densities were measured by calculating the number of bytes in a  nt data payload with  codewords used for the strand index with the codeword length given as l 
 the size of the index was chosen to accommodate  strands 
 capacity for each density and corresponding number of oligos system capacity was calculated assuming  strands per file which roughly corresponds to the number of strands that can be sequenced at a time in nextgeneration sequencing we further assumed that each strand occurred  times in replicate 
 note these capacity calculations were based on the number of oligos found in our search supplementary fig  not the total number that may be available if we searched the entire space of all possible  nt oligos searching for more oligos will result in greater system capacity but searching the entire space is intractable using our current approach
